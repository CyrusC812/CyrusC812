## Hi, I’m Cyrus Chung

I’m a GCSE student interested in aerospace engineering and applied engineering design.
I enjoy turning ideas into physical and digital solutions through CAD, 3D printing, and testing.

## Areas of focus
- Aerospace engineering concepts
- CAD modelling and mechanical design
- Prototyping and iterative testing
- Programming as a tool for analysis and automation in fusion 360

## Current work
- Learning Python for engineering applications
- Developing CAD skills using Onshape
- Planning and documenting future engineering projects
- Strengthening academic performance through feedback and analysis of assessment results
